The data was gathered from a response of https://www.hopsteiner.com/variety-data-sheets/, which receives all the data here: https://www.hopsteiner.com/variety-data-sheets/?l=en&data=1&ver=1.0.6

This can be found in the developer menu (F12) under network responses, and is parsed as a json.

Alternatively, the console can be used, and the data can be accessed in the variable: _window._vf__
